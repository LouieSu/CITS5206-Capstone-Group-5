# CITS5206 Information Technology Capstone Project: UWA Study Planner

## Introduction

This repository contains the CITS5206 Information Technology Capstone Project for **Group 5**. The goal of this project is to develop a web-based application that generates and manages study plans for select postgraduate courses at the University of Western Australia, initially focusing on the **Master of Information Technology (MIT)** and **Master of Data Science (MDS)** programs. 

This project is part of the final-semester **Information Technology Capstone Project** (CITS5206) unit, which involves close collaboration with an industry client, academic facilitators, and a student team. Our main objective is to automate and simplify the study plan management process, replacing the existing manual approach.

## Project Overview

1. **Course Coverage**  
   - The software first targets the Master of IT (MIT) and the Master of Data Science (MDS), with the potential to expand to other programs in the future.

2. **Automated Plan Generation**  
   - Using data exported from UWA’s CAIDi system (which stores official unit rules, prerequisites, and semester availability), the planner automatically creates a valid and feasible study plan based on the student’s starting semester and other course rules.

3. **Customizable Options**  
   - Students can add or modify option units and electives to fit their personal preferences or degree requirements.

4. **Interactive Visualization**  
   - The system provides an interactive view of the entire study plan, allowing students to see how units fit together and how prerequisites may affect scheduling.

5. **Import & Export Study Plans**  
   - The app allows students to export their study plan status or import an existing plan for further changes. No long-term storage of student data is maintained by this application.
